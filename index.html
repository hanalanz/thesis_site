As both a designer and journalist, I always assumed my processes for both would be pretty similar, but when exploring that further I was proven wrong. For an artist, their process is what makes them unique and shows behind their work but to grow as an artist one needs to question their processes.

				In an ever changing world of both design and journalism it’s apt for one to examine the processes of their work to find better, more productive or creative methods. From an outsider's perspective all creative processes may seem to be the same, but in my own finding that could not be farther from the truth. Writing and design have their own unique processes but by observing both processes they can have an impact to innovate one another.

To truly examine my own process, I needed to do some research. I decided the only unbiased way to truly look at my processes was to record myself both writing and designing. Besides me constantly getting distracted, there was really no pattern to my designing and writing processes. For both I started with research but then after that is where similarities end. For my writing process I almost immediately start diving into writing and write until I feel done and someone can edit but my design process was different; it was constantly changing and shifting direction.

	Haerin Shit at Vanderbilt University did research on the impact of the design and writing process on eachother and noticed that “The design process isn’t linear, it’s iterative,” and discusses how once we realize that in both our design and writing processes we become more okay with failure and false starts. When I design I almost never design something from the start to finish but do one part then another then go back and then do something completely different but when I write it is always a linear process. When Shin had her students write in a nonlinear way she said it “helps her students find meaning and arguments through divergent thinking.”			</p>

Using design processes as a way to write is becoming increasingly necessary in journalism as technology is changing the scope of the field. Both writing and design have something fundamental in common communication, but with technology taking over journalism it’s imperative that we take the humanistic approach that design processes have and apply them to journalism. 			</p>
